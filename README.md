# Simple Synth

A simple synthesizer built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs), and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Tested in latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Try it out [here](https://marcusmathioudakis.github.io/simple-synth/).
 
 ## Known issues:

- Safari: currently untested - do not have access to an Apple device atm!

- Edge: frequency slider-handle does not show.
