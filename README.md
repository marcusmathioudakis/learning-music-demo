# Simple Synth

A simple synthesizer built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs), and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Try it out [here](https://marcusmathioudakis.github.io/simple-synth/).
 
 ## Known issues (to be fixed soon):

- Mobile/smaller screens: mapping of frequencies to keys problematic on smaller screens, particularly mobile - frequency range always spans 12KHz but there can be as few as 7 piano keys on mobile displays.

- keys keyboard keys don't light up when tapped mobile devices.

- Safari: untested so far.

- Edge: broken in various ways.
