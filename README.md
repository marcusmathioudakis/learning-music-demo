# learning-music-demo
A page demonstrating a potential extension to Ableton's https://learningmusic.ableton.com/ tutorial series. Please note that the page is intentionally replicating the design of https://learningmusic.ableton.com/ for this reason: it is a prototype of a new page to be added to the site. Also note that any issues with the content are the author's sole responsibility - this work is in no way endorsed by Ableton.

Known issues (to be fixed soon):

– Mobile/smaller screens: mapping of frequencies to keys problematic on smaller screens, particularly mobile - frequency range always spans 12KHz but there can be as few as 7 piano keys on mobile displays.

– keys keyboard keys don't light up when tapped mobile devices.

– Safari: untested so far.

– Edge: broken in various ways.

– Firefox: frequency slider right padding + resizing window causes the oscillator to flicker.

– All gui elements should be widgets!!!!
