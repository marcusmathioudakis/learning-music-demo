# Simple Synth
A simple synthesizer built using React and the Web Audio API.

Known issues (to be fixed soon):

– Mobile/smaller screens: mapping of frequencies to keys problematic on smaller screens, particularly mobile - frequency range always spans 12KHz but there can be as few as 7 piano keys on mobile displays.

– keys keyboard keys don't light up when tapped mobile devices.

– Safari: untested so far.

– Edge: broken in various ways.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
